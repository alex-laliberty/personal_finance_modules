Thank you for using this Smart Personal Finance Analyzer!
-

To begin, the following files are required for the proper function of this program:
  1. financial_functions.py
  2. financial_analyzer.py
  3. financial_transactions.csv
  4. errors.txt
  5. financial_summaries.txt

Start by running financial_analyzer.py and load your transactions using option 1.  This will make all transactions in your financial_transactions.csv file available for viewing, updating, deleting, and analyzing; you may also add transactions. All these functions are described in greater detail below.

As transactions are loaded, any transactions with erroneous data will be excluded from analysis and will be unavailable for viewing.  Descriptions of the errors encountered by the program will be available in errors.txt and will also be displayed after loading transactions within the program.

Use the personal finance analyzer to perform the following functions:
  - 
  1. View transactions: All valid transactions and their details will be displayed in a table
  2. Add transactions: Add new transactions by providing transaction details when prompted. A completed transaction will automatically be saved to file.
  3. Update transactions: Change any transaction detail. Updates are automatically saved to file.
  4. Delete transactions: Remove transactions from financial_transactions.csv
  5. Analyze finances: Create a report of credit, debit, and transfer totals, as well as your net balance; you may even create reports by year.  The program will also generate the report in a text file if requested.  Reports are date-stamped so you may keep track of changes over time.
